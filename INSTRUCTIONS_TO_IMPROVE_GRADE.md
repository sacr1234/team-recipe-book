```bash
git add leon-recipe.html index.html
git commit -m "Add Leon's [recipe name] recipe - Leon"
git push origin main
```

#### Option 2: Add Recipe Tips Section (Good - 25 min)
1. Create `tips.html` with cooking tips from each team member
2. Add tips like:
   - "Drake's tip: Keep butter cold for flaky biscuits"
   - "Mayowa's tip: Use multiple cheese types for best flavor"
   - "Zaigham's tip: Don't overwork pizza dough"
   - Add your own tips
3. Style it nicely
4. Link from index.html
5. **Make at least 4 commits**

#### Option 3: Improve All Recipes with Additional Info (Good - 30 min)
1. Add "Difficulty Level" to each recipe (Easy/Medium/Hard)
2. Add "Total Time" (prep + cook)
3. Add "Cost Estimate" ($, $$, $$$)
4. Add nutritional highlights (optional)
5. Update all 5 recipe files
6. **Make at least 5 commits (one per file)**

**WARNING:** You must contribute meaningfully or risk failing. The team cannot carry non-participants.

**Problem:** Only 2 commits (5% participation) - lowest on the team.

**Current Grade: D+ (68%)**
**Target Grade: B+ (88%)**

### What Zaigham Must Do:

In addition to fixing your spelling errors and HTML issues (Steps 1 & 3), you must:

1. **Add detailed prep/cook instructions to your pizza recipe:**
   - Add dough-making instructions (or specify store-bought)
   - Add oven temperature and baking time
   - Add tips for checking when pizza is done

2. **Help with CSS implementation:**
   - Work with Drake/Kevin to test CSS on all pages
   - Make sure images display correctly
   - Fix any styling issues

3. **Add images to other recipes if missing:**
   - Verify all recipes have images
   - Optimize image sizes if needed

4. **Create a "Nutrition Tips" section in your recipe:**
